A lot of times, the CSV file you're given (especially like in the Titanic dataset), you'll have a lot of missing values in the dataset, which you have to identify. The following **isnull** function will figure out if there are any missing values in the dataframe, and will then sum up the total for each column. In this case, we have a pretty clean dataset."
